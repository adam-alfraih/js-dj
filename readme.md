# Javascript DJ

'JS DJ' is the first project I've created during an intensive 9 week bootcamp at Ironhack.
This project was created in 5 days.

## Overview

This is a front-end web app.

### My idea

-   A JavaScript browser game created using p5.js, a JavaScript library.
-   An algorithm shuffles 3 rednered CDs, with only one being the correct CD that wins the game.

### What can a user do?

Play as a DJ in a Berlin club. Your job is to please the demanding crowd by playing music that they desperately want to hear.
-   The player can move using the arrow keys
-   The player can pick up and drop CDs using spacebar
-   The player can interact with the Dj Mixer by dropping a CD within the radius of the mixer.


## Built with

-   HTML/CSS
-   Javascript
-   p5.js
-   Adobe Photoshop
-   Adobe Premiere Pro
